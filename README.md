## 💡 Introduction

The goal of Solsken is to be an effective, usable cross-platform weather app with worldwide support, presenting **all** information the APIs provide. Mobile use is prioritized heavily, and the UI and UX are built to provide an experience as close to native as possible.

Solsken allows use of two different **weather providers:**

- [SMHI](https://opendata.smhi.se/) (for Fennoscandian countries)
- [YR.no](https://developer.yr.no/) (for worldwide use)

Additionally, the app employs an efficient caching system in accordance with respective weather provider's usage policy.
